## Keys to lose fat:

    1. Calorie deficit
    2. Cardio
    3. Protein
    4. Weight lifting

**TDEE:**\
BMR - 1800\
Sedentery - 2200\
Light exercise - 2500\
Moderate exercise - 2800

**-20%**\
Sedentery - 1760\
Light exercise - 2000\
Moderate exercise - 2240

**-25%**\
Sedentery - 1650\
Light exercise - 1875\
Moderate exercise - 2100

### Calorie deficit.

1. Energy intake > energy expenditure
2. Slower rate tends to result in better body composition

### Protein Intake.

1. Better for muscle growth/retention
2. 1.5-2g/kg/day - is upper limit, 1g/kg/day - is lower limit ~150g

### Resistance Training.

1. The main reason to growth/retention muscles

### Cardio

1. Just burns calories
2. Aim to around 5k-10k

### Sleep

1. Sleep is fundumental for fat loss

1. Sleep, APA oils , Glutamine, Fermanted foods, iodine selenium
2. Nervous System: Mobilization and oxidation
3. Fidgeting & Shivering: A Powerful Science-Supported Method For Fat Loss
4. How Fidgeting Works: Promotes Epinephrine Release into Fat. “N-E-A-T”
5. Cold shower: 1-5 per week, ~12C, 1-3 minutes of relax, get in shower till you shiver for 1-2 minutes 3 times.
6. High intensity training followed by moderate-low intensity, fasted.
7. 100-400mg coffein 30-40 minutes before exercise can lead to more fat oxidazation
8. Drink yerba mate before before exercise can lead to fat loss
9. Low carbohydrates for low insulin through the day, more carbs closer to night for better sleep
10. acytyl-L-carnitine works, have a lot of positive things.

## 1. Fat loss occurs because of calorie deficit

Calories consumed (Food, drinks, etc) < Calories burned

#### Calories Burned

    1. Resting Energy Expenditure
    2. Exercise Activity Thermogenesis
    3. Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis
    4. Thermic Effect of food

## 2. Metabolic Adaptation

Keep in mind!

## 3. The holy grail

    1. Calorie deficit
    2. Weight training
    3. Enough protein

## 4. Long-term fat loss strategies

1. Diet slowly so it barely feels like you dieting at all
